description: Shared methodology for turning an approved feature analysis into a thorough Detailed Design (DD) document, across any platform. Used by /dev-design-start alongside the platform-specific dev-planning skill (rn-/ios-/android-/react-dev-planning) for the Technical Implementation Approach section's vocabulary and standard IDs. This skill NEVER generates development tasks — /dev-feature-start does that from an approved DD. It NEVER modifies source code.

## Methodology

Generate a thorough Detailed Design grounded in repository facts already captured by the Analyze stage, validated against the design, and ready for `/dev-feature-start` to consume. This skill **never** generates implementation tasks and **never** modifies source code.

### Step 1 — Locate the approved feature analysis (input gate)

1. Resolve the feature name to its `templates/feature-analysis-template.md` from a prior `/analyze-feature` run.
2. **Confirm its frontmatter `status` is `approved`.** If it is still `proposed`, stop and ask a human to review and approve it first — do not design against an unapproved analysis.
3. Read the `platform` frontmatter field — this is authoritative. **Do not re-run platform detection.** Read the `figma_link` field too; it carries forward into the DD.

The approved feature analysis IS the specification for this DD: its Feature Request, repo-analyst's detected conventions, the architect's Proposed Technical Approach, and its Figma link are the inputs. Do not re-interrogate the developer for a spec path or Figma URL that the analysis already carries.

### Step 2 — Decide detail level and existing-file strategy

Ask the developer two things before generating:

1. **Detail level** — `Standard` (covers every required section concisely) or `Comprehensive` (deep-dives every section with rationale, tradeoffs, extended edge cases).
2. **If a DD already exists for this feature** — how to handle it: `Overwrite` / `Update` (merge new findings) / `Preserve` (write to a new filename) / `Version` (rename the existing file, e.g. append `-v1`, before writing). **Never blindly overwrite an existing DD.**

### Step 3 — Read all available context

Read, in this order, everything that exists — do not skip any:

1. The **approved feature analysis** (spec + detected conventions + proposed approach).
2. The **Figma design** via the Figma MCP tool, if `figma_link` is set. If Figma access fails for any reason (auth, invalid URL, MCP unavailable, timeout), stop immediately with the exact error and do not generate any part of the DD — the DD cannot be built without the design it depends on.
3. `docs/` and any architecture/integration/ADR notes, if present.
4. **Repository inspection** — browse the relevant source directories, existing components, services, and API routes to understand the actual implementation landscape.

### Step 4 — Validate consistency

Cross-check inputs against each other and actively hunt for gaps across every dimension:

- **Spec vs Design** — does every flow in the analysis appear in Figma, and every screen in Figma map to a requirement? Are labels/terminology consistent?
- **Design vs Architecture** — can every UI element be built with the current component library / design system per the detected conventions? Are new components needed and feasible? Do navigation patterns match existing routing conventions?
- **Completeness** — flag anything missing or ambiguous across: loading states, empty states, error states, happy + failure/edge user flows, every screen transition, permissions/roles, analytics events, API requirements, backend requirements, validation rules, edge cases (boundaries, concurrency, stale data, races), accessibility, responsive/breakpoint behaviour, i18n/RTL, feature flags / rollout strategy.

### Step 5 — Surface gaps and confirm

If any **important** gap is found, stop and present a structured, labelled list of clarification questions (`[MISSING — …]`, `[AMBIGUOUS — …]`) before generating. Do not continue until critical gaps are resolved; minor gaps (e.g. exact copy) can be recorded as Open Questions in the DD.

Only proceed to generation when you are **≥90% confident** that the design matches the analysis, the approach is clear, the UX is understood end-to-end, all dependencies are identified, and edge cases are sufficiently covered. If you cannot reach 90%, explain what is blocking confidence and ask how to proceed.

### Step 6 — Generate the DD

Populate `templates/dd-template.md` in full. Apply the existing-file strategy chosen in Step 2. Place it where the repo keeps design docs (check `docs/` conventions) or at the repo root; default filename `{FEATURE-NAME}-DD.md`.

- **Frontmatter:** carry `figma_link` and `platform` from the feature analysis; set `feature_analysis_link` to the analysis path, `status: draft`, `detail_level`, `date`.
- **Technical Implementation Approach (§19) and Impacted Modules (§20):** delegate platform vocabulary and standard-ID citations to the matching platform-specific dev-planning skill (`rn-/ios-/android-/react-dev-planning`) via the matching architect — a single flat section for one platform, or platform-tagged subsections (`### React Native` / `### iOS` / `### Android` / `### React` / `### Cross-Platform Coordination`) when `platform: mixed`.
- Fill every section; write `N/A — [reason]` where one genuinely does not apply. In comprehensive mode, expand with rationale and tradeoffs.
- **Leave `status: draft`** until a human explicitly approves — `/dev-feature-start` reads only an approved DD.

## Constraints

- **Never generate implementation tasks.** `/dev-feature-start` does that from an approved DD.
- **Never modify source code.**
- **Never re-run platform detection** — read `platform` from the approved feature analysis.
- **Never blindly overwrite** an existing DD — honour the Step 2 existing-file strategy.
- **Never ignore an unresolved critical gap** — flag it and stop.
- **Always prioritise repository facts** (the feature analysis, detected conventions, actual source) over assumptions.
