description: Implement a single approved task from a feature's task breakdown.
argument-hint: [feature] [task-id]
---

Orchestrate the implementation of **exactly one** approved task. This command is an orchestrator only: it resolves and verifies the full implementation context, enforces the approval/readiness gates, routes to the correct platform, and hands the resolved context to that platform's feature-implementation skill. It contains **no platform coding methodology** — the platform skill owns how the code is written; the `require-approval-before-code`, `block-main-branch-changes`, and `protect-secrets` hooks gate the writes.

Do not invoke any implementation agent until every step below has passed. If any step fails, **stop, state the exact missing/failed condition, and do not edit code.**

## 1. Resolve the task identity from `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as `[feature] [task-id]` (e.g. `biometric-login T3`).

- A **task id is required** and must be explicit (e.g. `T3`). Do not accept a vague feature description as a substitute for a task id.
- A **feature identifier is required** to disambiguate — task ids are not globally unique (every feature's breakdown starts at `T1`).
- If the task id is missing, or the feature is missing/ambiguous, or the pair cannot identify exactly one task, **stop and ask the user for `[feature] [task-id]`.** Do not guess.

## 2. Resolve one authoritative repository root (via the helper)

Run the plugin's deterministic helper — do not reimplement worktree logic here:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-target-repo-root.ts" "<candidate>"
```

(`bun` works too.) `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted inline in this command's text at load time (per the Claude Code plugins reference), so it expands to the installed plugin's absolute root before you run the command — it is **not** read from the shell environment, and does not require the user's shell to export it. The helper itself takes an explicit path argument and depends on no environment variable. `<candidate>` is the developer-supplied repo path if given, otherwise the current working directory. Read the JSON on stdout:

- Exit `0` and `ok: true` → use `targetRoot` as the single repository-root authority for the rest of this command (`TARGET_ROOT`).
- Exit `1` (path not found), exit `3`, `ok: false`, or `targetIsWorktree: true` → **stop and report.** Never treat a `.claude/worktrees/…` path as the target.
- If `unwrapped: true`, tell the user the command is targeting the main working tree, not the Claude agent worktree it was launched from.

Do not trust ambient CWD as the root on its own — the helper's `targetRoot` is authoritative.

## 3. Locate the Task Breakdown for the feature

Using the feature identifier from step 1, locate that feature's **Task Breakdown** file under `TARGET_ROOT` (where the repo keeps design docs — check `docs/` conventions and the repo root; the breakdown is the generated feature artifact, never `templates/task-breakdown-template.md`). If you cannot locate exactly one Task Breakdown for the feature, **stop and ask the user for its path** — do not guess filenames.

## 4. Resolve the upstream documents from frontmatter (no filename guessing)

Read the Task Breakdown's frontmatter and resolve the linked documents:

- `feature_analysis_link` → the approved **Feature Analysis**
- `dd_link` → the approved **Detailed Design (DD)**
- `dev_plan_link` → the approved **Dev Plan**
- the **Task Breakdown** itself (this file)

Then:

- Resolve each link to an absolute path and confirm the file exists. If a required link field is missing or its target does not exist, **stop and report which one** — resolve through the frontmatter links, do not reconstruct filenames.
- **Verify every resolved path is inside `TARGET_ROOT`.** Any path that escapes `TARGET_ROOT` or resolves under `.claude/worktrees/…` → stop and report.
- **Verify feature identity is consistent across documents:** the `feature` in the breakdown matches the DD and Dev Plan; the DD's `feature_analysis_link` points at the same Feature Analysis; the Dev Plan's `dd_link` points at the same DD. On any cross-feature mismatch → stop and report the mismatch.

## 5. Approval & readiness gates

Confirm **all** of the following before going further. On any failure, stop, name the exact condition, and do not invoke an implementation agent:

- Feature Analysis exists and `status: approved`.
- DD exists and `status: approved` — and is **not** marked dry-run only. A DD in `draft` or dry-run → stop.
- Dev Plan exists and `status: approved`.
- Task Breakdown exists and `status: approved` (not `draft`).
- The selected task row exists in the breakdown.
- The selected task is **not already complete** (see step 10 for how completion is/ isn't tracked) and is **not blocked**.
- Every `depends-on` task is complete — see step 6.
- No unresolved blocker referenced by the task remains.
- `platform` is present and valid on the row.
- `device_type` is present and valid — exactly `mobile` or `tv` — resolved from the selected task row if it carries one, otherwise from the Task Breakdown frontmatter. If it is **missing/empty**, is an **invalid value** (anything other than `mobile`/`tv`, including `mixed`), or conflicts between the row and the frontmatter, **stop and report the exact condition** — never default to `mobile` and never re-detect it here.
- For UI-touching work, a `figma_link` is available (breakdown/Dev Plan/DD). If absent → stop and ask.
- Branch is **not** `main`/`master` (the `block-main-branch-changes` hook enforces this on write; check it up front too) and repository policy allows edits.

## 6. Dependency completeness (deterministic where possible, else ask)

For each task in the selected task's `depends-on`:

- If its completion can be proven from a deterministic field or approved artifact, use that proof.
- If it cannot be proven, **stop and ask the user for explicit evidence or confirmation** (e.g. merged commits/PRs).
- Do **not** silently assume a dependency is complete, and do **not** implement dependency tasks yourself.

> **Known follow-up gap (do not build in this change):** the plugin has no deterministic per-task lifecycle/status store, so "task complete" and dependency completeness are not machine-verifiable end-to-end yet. Until that exists, this step relies on user-confirmed evidence. A future change should add a deterministic task-status mechanism.

## 7. Platform routing (read from the task row; never re-detect)

Read the `platform` value from the selected task row — do **not** re-run platform detection. Route:

| Row `platform` | Agent | Skill | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `react-native` | `rn-feature-developer` | `rn-feature-implementation` | active |
| `android` | `android-feature-developer` | `android-feature-implementation` | active |
| `ios` | `ios-feature-developer` | `ios-feature-implementation` | check readiness |
| `react` | `react-feature-developer` | `react-feature-implementation` | check readiness |

- **iOS / React:** before invoking, check the target skill and agent for a "not yet authored / structure-only placeholder" marker. If present, **stop with: "Platform implementation methodology for `<platform>` is not yet authored"** — do not pretend the route is production-ready and do not author it here. (When those skills are later authored and the marker is gone, the route opens automatically.)
- **Multiple platforms on one row:** the task model is single-platform-per-row. If a row lists more than one platform, **stop and require it to be split into one task per platform** at `/dev-feature-start`. Do not invent a cross-platform lead agent, and do not invoke unrelated platform agents.

## 8. Pass explicit resolved context to the selected agent + skill

Invoke the routed platform's feature-implementation skill via its feature-developer agent, passing these resolved, verified values as authoritative inputs (the skill must not search ambiently or guess filenames):

- absolute `TARGET_ROOT` (repository root)
- absolute **Feature Analysis** path
- absolute **DD** path
- absolute **Dev Plan** path
- absolute **Task Breakdown** path
- selected **task id**
- selected **task row content**
- **platform**
- **device_type** (`mobile` or `tv`) — the resolved mobile-vs-TV context signal from step 5; passed through as authoritative context. It does **not** change platform routing (§7): a `tv` task runs on the same platform feature-developer agent + feature-implementation skill as a `mobile` task.
- **figma_link**, if any
- **dependency status** (from step 6)
- **approval status** (from step 5)
- **unresolved-blocker status**

Pass the actual document **paths**, preserving the source-of-truth hierarchy — do not collapse them into a single generated summary that omits the source documents:

- **Feature Analysis** — business objective, platform context, repository findings.
- **DD** — architecture, technical approach, API contracts, impacted modules, approved decisions.
- **Dev Plan** — sequencing, dependencies, rollout, rollback.
- **Task Breakdown** — the task inventory.
- **Selected task row** — current implementation scope and acceptance criteria (the completion contract).

## 9. Scope: exactly one task

Implement only the selected task. Do **not** auto-continue to the next task, implement dependency tasks, expand the task, change approved API contracts/business rules, edit the DD/plan silently, or resolve blockers. If the task cannot be completed within its approved scope, **stop, report the conflict, and recommend a new task or a DD amendment** rather than absorbing the extra work.

## 10. Completion handling (report; do not mutate status)

After the platform skill finishes, require its structured completion report and confirm it covers:

- each acceptance criterion checked individually,
- validation commands run and their exact results,
- files changed,
- applied standard IDs,
- deviations and blockers,
- confirmation that no unrelated scope was added,
- confirmation that the writes landed inside `TARGET_ROOT` (not in `.claude/worktrees/…`).

**Do not mark the task complete automatically.** The plugin has no approved task-status-mutation mechanism, so this command must **not** edit the Task Breakdown (or any file) to flip a task's status. Report completion for the human to act on. Do not report success if any acceptance criterion failed, required validation failed, a dependency is unproven, a blocker remains, the implementation deviates from the DD without approval, or changes exist only inside a worktree.

## Responsibility boundary

This command orchestrates (task-id resolution, repo-root resolution via the helper, document-path resolution, approval/dependency/blocker checks, platform routing, hook gating, invoking the correct agent+skill, passing resolved context). It does **not** contain Android/iOS/RN/React coding methodology, architecture guidance, review methodology, or the implementation logic itself — those live in the platform feature-implementation skills.
